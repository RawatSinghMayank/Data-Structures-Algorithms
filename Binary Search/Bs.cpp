Binary search works for monotonic functions -> means which maintains  a given order

ex-> 1 2 3 4 65 90
     90 80 50 20 1
     both monotonic

     like x square graph is always increasing so you can apply bs here
     
     we can also apply binary search on predicate functions (that return true or false)

    ex->
     fffffffttttttttt
     ttttttttffffffff
